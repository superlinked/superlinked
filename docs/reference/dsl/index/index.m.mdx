title: "Index"
description: "Create and configure indexes to organize spaces for efficient data querying in Superlinked"
---

The `Index` class is a core abstraction that represents a collection of spaces, enabling you to query your data efficiently. An index organizes multiple spaces and their associated fields to create a unified querying interface.

## Constructor

Create a new index with the specified configuration.

```python
Index(
    spaces,
    fields=None,
    fields_to_exclude=None,
    effects=None,
    max_age=None,
    max_count=None,
    temperature=0.5,
    event_influence=0.5,
    time_decay_floor=1.0
)
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="spaces" type="Space | list[Space]" required>
  The space or list of spaces to include in the index. These define the vector
  representations for your data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fields" type="SchemaField | list[SchemaField]" default="None">
  The field or list of fields to be indexed. If not specified, all fields from
  the spaces will be indexed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fields_to_exclude" type="SchemaField | list[SchemaField]" default="None">
  Excludes fields from storage and query results.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="effects" type="Effect | list[Effect]" default="None">
  A list of conditional interactions within a space that modify vector behavior
  based on events or conditions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_age" type="datetime.timedelta" default="None">
  Maximum age of events to be considered. Older events will be filtered out when
  specified. Use this to implement time-based data retention.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_count" type="int" default="None">
  **Batch system only**: Restricts how many events should be considered based on
  their age. Does not apply to real-time systems.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="temperature" type="float" default="0.5">
  Controls event contribution during aggregation. Must be between 0 and 1. -
  Values closer to **0**: Give more weight to stored event aggregates - Values
  closer to **1**: Give more weight to new events being added
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="event_influence" type="float" default="0.5">
  Controls how much the final aggregated event vector influences the base
  vector. Must be between 0 and 1. - Values closer to **0**: Keep results closer
  to the base vector - Values closer to **1**: Make results more influenced by
  aggregated events
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="time_decay_floor" type="float" default="1.0">
  Controls the time decay curve for event weights. - **Higher values**: Create
  more gradual decay over time - **Lower values**: Create steeper decay curves
</ParamField>

### Example

```python
from superlinked import Index
from datetime import timedelta

# Create an index with multiple spaces
product_index = Index(
    spaces=[text_space, category_space, price_space],
    fields_to_exclude=[schema.internal_id, schema.created_by],
    max_age=timedelta(days=30),
    temperature=0.7,
    event_influence=0.6
)
```

<Warning>
  The index will raise an `InvalidInputException` if no spaces are provided.
</Warning>

## Properties

### non_nullable_fields

```python
non_nullable_fields: Sequence[SchemaField]
```

Returns the sequence of schema fields that cannot contain null values in this index.

### schemas

```python
schemas: Sequence[SchemaObject]
```

Returns the sequence of schema objects associated with this index's spaces.

## Methods

### has_schema()

Check if a given schema is used as input to any of the index's spaces.

```python
has_schema(schema: SchemaObject) -> bool
```

<ParamField path="schema" type="SchemaObject" required>
  The schema object to check for presence in the index.
</ParamField>

**Returns**: `bool` - True if the schema is found, False otherwise.

#### Example

```python
# Check if a schema is part of the index
if product_index.has_schema(product_schema):
    print("Product schema is indexed")
```

### has_space()

Check if a given space is present in the index.

```python
has_space(space: Space) -> bool
```

<ParamField path="space" type="Space" required>
  The space object to check for presence in the index.
</ParamField>

**Returns**: `bool` - True if the space is found, False otherwise.

#### Example

```python
# Verify a space is included in the index
if product_index.has_space(text_space):
    print("Text space is part of this index")
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Index Design**: Group related spaces together in a single index to enable
  efficient multi-dimensional queries. For example, combine text, categorical,
  and numerical spaces for product data.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Event Parameters**: Start with default values for `temperature` and
  `event_influence` (0.5), then adjust based on your specific use case and data
  patterns.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Batch vs Real-time**: The `max_count` parameter only affects batch
  processing systems and has no impact on real-time query performance.
</Warning>
