# Overview

Superlinked's framework is broadly divided into 2 modules:
- Common: Contains components that help your parse data and define your schema.
  - [DAG](../reference/common/dag/period_time.md), [Parser](../reference/common/parser/data_parser.md), [Schema](../reference/common/schema/schema.md)
- DSL: Contains components that are used to define the vector computation.
  - [App](../reference/dsl/app/index.md), [Executor](../reference/dsl/executor/index.md), [Index](../reference/dsl/index/index.md), [Query](../reference/dsl/query/index.md), [Registry](../reference/dsl/registry/index.md), [Source](../reference/dsl/source/index.md), [Space](../reference/dsl/space/index.md), [Storage](../reference/dsl/storage/index.md)

Please refer to the [concepts](../concepts/overview.md) section for a high-level overview of the framework.
